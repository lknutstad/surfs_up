## Overview

### Purpose

While trying to open a surf shop, a friend has reached out for help with a weather data set to see how it may impact his business

## Analysis
- June and December had similar average temperatures (within a few degrees).
- More temperature measurements were taken during June than in December
- The maximum temps were higher in August than in December
- The low temps were lower in December than in August

## Summary
- I would include precipitation, as this effects surf conditions as much as temperature
- I would include wind, as this effects surf conditions as much as temperature
